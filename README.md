# CellSketch

## Aim of the project

CellSketch can be used to collect masks and labels belonging to the same 3D scene into one project. The routines are primarily targeting and used but not limited to single cell datasets. All imported datasets are stored in the N5 format as blocks. They can be displayed with BigDataViewer. All labels imported as labelmaps can be spatially analyzed in relation to other labelmaps and masks. Results are stored as tables. A routine for generating plots based on the analysis is provided as well. Finally, masks and labelmaps can be exported as meshes, displayed with VTK and rendered using Blender.
